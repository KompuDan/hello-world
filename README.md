# hello-world
This is the guide example
This is my first time using GitHUb, since Bere told me too much aboit it and i start thinking about working on a big proyect, i thing i need to learn to use it.
Well, it seems that i go a little futher the last time a edit this file, so i've come to make another change in order to follow the guide.
